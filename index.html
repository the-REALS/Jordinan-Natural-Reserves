                Azraq is a unique wetland, located in the heart of the arid Eastern Desert, which takes its name from
                the
                Arabic word for ‘blue’. A migratory stopover for birds from three continents, Azraq is becoming
                increasingly
                popular for bird watching. From the walkways and hides, visitors get the chance to observe birds close
                at
                hand,
                including local, migratory and occasional rare species. The Azraq area also has a rich cultural history
                due
                to its strategic <span id="doot">... </span><span id="more">location and water resources. It was

                    used as a station for pilgrims and camel trains and Lawrence of Arabia was stationed in Azraq Castle
                    during
                    the
                    Arab Revolt. The local people are also unusually diverse, coming from three different ethnic
                    origins,
                    Bedouin,
                    Chechen and Druze; each of which has distinctive beliefs and traditions. Bedouins have lived a
                    nomadic
                    life
                    style in the area for generations, whereas the Chechens are descendants of settlers from the
                    Caucasus
                    and
                    the Druze stem from Arab tribes in Syria and Lebanon Many
                    interesting archaeological sites lie within easy reach of Azraq Lodge, including the famous but
                    misnamed‘desert castles’: Qasr Amra, Qasr Kharana and Azraq Castle. Qasr Amra is one of the
                    best-preserved Umayyad
                    bathhouses in the world and a World Heritage Site. Its interior walls are covered in lively frescos
                    dating
                    back to 700 AD. There are also many dramatic desert landscapes to discover, including moon-like
                    plains
                    of black
                    basalt and white valleys of chalk.

                Dana is Jordan’s largest nature reserve, covering some 320 square kilometers of spectacular mountains
                and
                Wadis along the face of the Great Rift Valley. From scorching sand dunes in the west to cool
                mountaintops in
                the east, the Dana Biosphere Reserve is home to a great variety of wildlife. There are plants and
                animals
                characteristic of true desert, of Mediterranean forests and of the dry plains of Russia. In fact, Dana
                is
                really a melting pot <span id="doot1">...</span><span id="more1">of species from three continents:
                    Europe,
                    Africa and Asia. Such a combination of


                    natural communities in a single area is unique in Jordan and many of Dana’s animals and plants are
                    very
                    rare. So far, a total of 700 plant species, 190 bird species, 37 mammal species and 36 reptile
                    species
                    have
                    been recorded in the Reserve, of which 25 are known to be endangered, including the Sand Cat, the
                    Syrian
                    Wolf, the Lesser Kestrel and the Spiny Tailed Lizard. Without special care, some of these could
                    disappear
                    from Earth forever, which makes the Dana Biosphere Reserve a place of global importance.overlooking

                At 410 meters below sea level, the Mujib Biosphere Reserve is the lowest nature reserve on Earth. Its
                rugged
                and spectacular mountains border the Dead Sea coast and are dissected by several river-filled canyons
                that
                offer the best river and adventure hikes in Jordan. The breathtaking scenery and the challenge of
                negotiating Mujib’s fast-flowing rivers make the Reserve one of Jordan’s most popular natural
                attractions.


                Mujib’s complex river system and <span id="doot2">...</span><span id="more2">all-year water flow enable

                    over
                    300 species of plants, 10 species of carnivores and numerous species of resident and migratory birds
                    have
                    been recorded. Some of the mountain and valley areas are difficult to reach and offer safe havens
                    for
                    rare
                    species of cats, mountain goats (Ibex) and other mountain animals. Adventure Center
