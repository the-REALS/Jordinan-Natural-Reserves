            Azraq is a unique wetland, located in the heart of the arid Eastern Desert, which takes its name from the
            Arabic word for ‘blue’. A migratory stopover for birds from three continents, Azraq is becoming increasingly
            popular for bird watching. From the walkways and hides, visitors get the chance to observe birds close at
            hand,
            including local, migratory and occasional rare species. The Azraq area also has a rich cultural history due
            to its strategic <span id="doot">... </span><span id="more">location and water resources. It was

                used as a station for pilgrims and camel trains and Lawrence of Arabia was stationed in Azraq Castle
                during
                the
                Arab Revolt. The local people are also unusually diverse, coming from three different ethnic origins,
                Bedouin,
                Chechen and Druze; each of which has distinctive beliefs and traditions. Bedouins have lived a nomadic
                life
                style in the area for generations, whereas the Chechens are descendants of settlers from the Caucasus
                and
                the Druze stem from Arab tribes in Syria and Lebanon Many
                interesting archaeological sites lie within easy reach of Azraq Lodge, including the famous but
                misnamed‘desert castles’: Qasr Amra, Qasr Kharana and Azraq Castle. Qasr Amra is one of the
                best-preserved Umayyad
                bathhouses in the world and a World Heritage Site. Its interior walls are covered in lively frescos
                dating
                back to 700 AD. There are also many dramatic desert landscapes to discover, including moon-like plains
                of black
                basalt and white valleys of chalk.

            Dana is Jordan’s largest nature reserve, covering some 320 square kilometers of spectacular mountains and
            Wadis along the face of the Great Rift Valley. From scorching sand dunes in the west to cool mountaintops in
            the east, the Dana Biosphere Reserve is home to a great variety of wildlife. There are plants and animals
            characteristic of true desert, of Mediterranean forests and of the dry plains of Russia. In fact, Dana is
            really a melting pot <span id="doot1">...</span><span id="more1">of species from three continents: Europe,
                Africa and Asia. Such a combination of


                natural communities in a single area is unique in Jordan and many of Dana’s animals and plants are very
                rare. So far, a total of 700 plant species, 190 bird species, 37 mammal species and 36 reptile species
                have
                been recorded in the Reserve, of which 25 are known to be endangered, including the Sand Cat, the Syrian
                Wolf, the Lesser Kestrel and the Spiny Tailed Lizard. Without special care, some of these could
                disappear
                from Earth forever, which makes the Dana Biosphere Reserve a place of global importance.overlooking  Without special

            At 410 meters below sea level, the Mujib Biosphere Reserve is the lowest nature reserve on Earth. Its rugged
            and spectacular mountains border the Dead Sea coast and are dissected by several river-filled canyons that
            offer the best river and adventure hikes in Jordan. The breathtaking scenery and the challenge of
            negotiating Mujib’s fast-flowing rivers make the Reserve one of Jordan’s most popular natural attractions.


            Mujib’s complex river system and <span id="doot2">...</span><span id="more2">all-year water flow enable it
                to support a rich biodiversity. To date,
                over
                300 species of plants, 10 species of carnivores and numerous species of resident and migratory birds
                have
                been recorded. Some of the mountain and valley areas are difficult to reach and offer safe havens for
                rare
                species of cats, mountain goats (Ibex) and other mountain animals. Adventure Center
